"""Collect BookStack-hosted image URLs from page markdown.

BookStack pages exported as markdown contain inline images like:

    ![alt](http://wiki.grad.net/uploads/images/gallery/2023-06/foo.png)

This module collects those URLs so that callers can upload each referenced
image as a separate IronRAG document (instead of inlining base64 data-URIs,
which caused multi-MB markdown documents that timed out graph extraction).

Rules:
- Only collect URLs whose host matches the BookStack base URL.
- Leave external image URLs (other hosts) unchanged and uncollected.
